# 📝 Huffman Compression in C++

Welcome to Huffman Compression in C++! This repository houses a simple yet effective implementation of the Huffman compression algorithm.

## 🔍 What's Huffman Compression?

Huffman compression is a nifty little technique for shrinking the size of text files. By assigning shorter codes to common characters and longer codes to rare ones, we can save space without sacrificing any data.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **🔒 Compression**: Reduce the size of text files using Huffman coding.
- **🔓 Decompression**: Unpack Huffman-encoded files effortlessly.
- **🎛️ Command-line Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for compression and decompression tasks.

## 💡 Getting Started

1. **Compile**: Use your favorite C++ compiler to compile the source code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o huffman huffman.cpp
   ```

2. **Compress**: Ready to save space? Compress a file:
   ```bash
   ./huffman input.txt
   ```

3. **Decompress**: Need to get back the original file? Decompress it:
   ```bash
   ./huffman input.graba
   ```
